Still in develop mode.

Module to convert any classic car's mecanical throttle system into an electronic one, mantaining its original carburator.

Aditionally adding a customizable mapping to set custom throttle sensitivity and an "ECO" mode.
The idea is to be able to set, control and monitor variables, and sensors through an APP or just by WiFi comunication (Only option available for both iOS and Android devices)

After ending this stage, Cruise Control will be added, aswell as a back-up system for main ESP failure, and a multiple car sensors monitor in real time, accurate speed, 
fuel economy, and more.
